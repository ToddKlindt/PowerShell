# PowerShell
This repo contains PowerShell scripts, snippets, and functions I talk about on [my blog](https://www.toddklindt.com/blog). Since I'll be updating these over time, they may differ slightly from the blog post they're from. 

Read them over before you run them, who knows what crazy things I've done in them. Most of the scripts here will need some tweaking before they run in your environment. If you have any questions leave an issue or send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/toddklindt) and I'll see what I can do.

To use the commands in ToddKlindtM365Commands.psm1 save it locally, then run this command:
```PowerShell
Import-Module PathToFile\ToddKlindtM365Commands.psm1 -force
```
To see what commands it has in it run this commands:
```PowerShell
Get-Command -Module ToddKlindtM365Commands
```
